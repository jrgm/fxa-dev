# For demonstation, use a larger instance type, and larger disk. For most
# uses, a t2.small is sufficient. However, the default 8GB gets a little
# cramped after a while. Definitely always use a t2 instance type since it's a
# good fit for the use case of an fxa-dev box (often idle, sometimes busy).
